## Title

XR Soma Design

## Abstract

“XR Soma Design” is an interdisciplinary course that explores the convergence of extended reality (XR), embodied interaction, and somaesthetics. In this course, the body is regarded as the central medium through which consciousness interacts with the world, emphasizing that our experiences of time, space, and sensation are deeply rooted in our physical form. Extended reality serves as a “glue medium” that connects reality with human experience, either broadening or alienating the interface through which the body interacts with its environment. Through practical explorations of ambiguous interface design, cognitive dissonance, and improvisational creation, students will employ biofeedback sensors, wearable systems, and interactive installations to reshape the boundaries between perception and technology, enhance sensory experiences and emotional resonance, and challenge the traditional limits between nature, technology, and human form. Additionally, the course will delve into advanced topics such as somaesthetics, embodied intersubjectivity, human augmentation, transhumanism, posthumanism, and technological entanglement, questioning whether language-dominated intelligence might reduce us to “ghost shells” or propel us to become part of an “entangled assemblage” deeply intertwined with technology.

## Logistics

We use Miro as our communication tools. Please make yourself home. 
We report your proposal using Miro and deliver your artwork and research using Miro. 

We will have office hours from March 

## Deliverables: 

Submit to Venues like SIGGRAPH Asia XR, Art Gallery, Art Paper, and TEI

Images of the work (1500px x 1000px, JPG at maximum quality)
Detailed description of the artistic concept, the essentials of how the work functions and technical realization (Since a presentation of an outstanding interactive work naturally also depends on the technical requirements for on-site realization, please include information that is as specific as possible about technical (Hardware/Software) and spatial requirements, as well as what you could contribute to a presentation of your work and what would need to be provided by the Ars Electronica.) 
Optional: additional material (images/documents(PDF)/drawings(JPG, PDF)) 

- Contributor information.
  - Full names of the artists
  - Email of the artists (don't use your qq number email)
  - ORCID of the artists
  - Biography of the artists
- Concept Sheet
  - Core concept
  - Provocation
    - Ethical issues to reflect
    - Asesthecs problem to aware.
  - Media
    - 
  - Tension
    - 
  
- Title
  - 15 words at max
- Synopsis.
  - 50-word description of your project that we can use in promotional materials
- Final representative image (1500 x 1000px, .jpg, .jpeg, .png), with up to five additional images.
- Abstract.
  - 150-200 word description of your project.
- Extended Abstract
  - 2 pages. A good abstract serves as an overview of your submission, provides background information, and highlights the novelty of your submission.
  - The document you submit for review should be a single column PDF, which can be prepared in Microsoft Word or LaTeX – we recommend the use of LaTeX, and the “manuscript” parameter to the \documentclass will prepare the PDF as a one-column document:  \documentclass[manuscript]{acmart}
- A floor plan.
  - PDF. 
  - This should include size, space, and environmental requirements to display your work on-site. Please indicate where you would like to place tables, chairs, your installation space, lighting requirements, and any equipment that needs to be suspended above the floor. It is important to label the plan with dimensions, and you may use whichever unit of length you are comfortable with (meters or feet). Please keep in mind that the standard area for each selected work is 10 x 10 feet, and we recommend fitting your presentation within this area.
- Video documentation (approx. 3 min.) 
  - Make sure that the video submitted represents the entirety of your experience.
- Website and URL for conference publicity and media/participant inquiries.
